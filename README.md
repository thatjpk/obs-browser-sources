## obs-browser-sources

A Collection of web-based widgets intended for use as OBS Studio sources via
the Browser Source plugin.  Each top-level directory is a separate source with
all dependencies included.  They can be used locally (via a `file://` url) or
hosted on a server.

### Sources

List of sources and short descriptions of each. See the READMEs in each
subdirectory for more documentation.

 - `clock-source` - A live timestamp

### gh-pages

The master branch of this repository is periodically merged into `gh-pages`, so
you can load widgets directly from github.  Like
[this](http://thatjpk.github.io/obs-browser-sources/clock-source/index.html).
However, if you want stability, it's still advised to download and use the files
locally.
