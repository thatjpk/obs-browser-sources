### clock-source

A live UTC timestamp with millisecond precision based on your system time. The
text is styled to fill the width of the window, so you can resize it to fit
into your scene by changing the rendering size of the browser source.


TODOs:

- Make font, color, etc configurable through url params or config file.
- Make timestamp format configurable through url params or config file.
